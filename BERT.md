### Abstract
**Summary**: The paper introduces BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a new method for pre-training language representations. BERT's key innovation is its ability to pre-train deep bidirectional representations by conditioning on both left and right context in all layers, unlike previous models that used unidirectional approaches. This allows BERT to perform exceptionally well across a variety of NLP tasks after fine-tuning with minimal modifications.

### Introduction
**Summary**: The introduction highlights the importance of language model pre-training for improving natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The paper argues that existing pre-training methods are limited by their unidirectional nature, which restricts their effectiveness in capturing context. BERT addresses this by using a bidirectional transformer model that is pre-trained using masked language modeling and next sentence prediction. This approach leads to state-of-the-art performance across a range of NLP benchmarks.

### BERT
**Pre-training BERT**  
**Summary**: BERT's pre-training involves two main tasks: masked language modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP). MLM randomly masks tokens in a sentence and trains the model to predict the masked tokens. NSP predicts whether a given sentence follows another sentence in a text. These tasks allow BERT to capture bidirectional context during pre-training.

**NSP**  
**Summary**: The Next Sentence Prediction task is designed to improve BERT's ability to understand the relationship between two sentences. It helps in tasks like question answering and natural language inference by training the model to predict whether one sentence logically follows another.

**Fine-tuning BERT**  
**Summary**: Fine-tuning BERT involves adapting the pre-trained model to specific NLP tasks by adding a task-specific layer and training on the task-specific data. The process is simple and effective, with BERT achieving state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks with minimal architecture changes.
